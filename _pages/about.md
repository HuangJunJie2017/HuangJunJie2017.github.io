*I am Junjie Huang, currently an algorithm researcher in PhiGent Robotics. Before that, I worked for Xforward AI Technology Co., LTD.*

*I received my M.Eng. from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 and B.Eng. from SCUT(South China University of Technology) in 2016.*

*Recently, I mainly focus on visual perception and E2E autonomous driving; My historical interest areas include 2D/3D object detection, BEV semantic segmentation, 2D Human Pose Estimation, Face Recognition, Facial Landmark Detection, Optical Flow, Motion Detection, Visual Servo.*
